    <div class="container my-5">
        <h1 class="text-center mb-4">About Us</h1>
        <p class="lead text-center">UNDRAFTED was born from a love for basketball and hip-hop. We are a brand that celebrates both cultures, blending them into unique clothing that speaks to those who are passionate about both worlds. Our aim is to create something that feels like home, something that speaks to your roots and your journey.</p>

        <section class="my-5">
            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Our Story</h2>
            <p>UNDRAFTED was created by individuals who grew up with basketball courts as their second home and speakers blasting hip-hop as their soundtrack. We wanted to create more than just a brand – we wanted to build a community. A place where individuals who share our love for both basketball and hip-hop can express their identity, their journey, and their culture.</p>
            <p>Each piece of clothing we design represents our roots, our hustle, and our dedication to what we love. UNDRAFTED is not just a clothing brand – it’s a lifestyle, a movement that celebrates staying true to oneself, whether on the court or in the streets.</p>
